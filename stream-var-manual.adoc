This is the user manual for StreamVar in StreamVar

== Introduction
Stream Var is a library to build analytics model. +
The StreamVar MDK (model development kit) is the utility to build the model mar given feature file written in StreamVar DSL.
StreamVar DSL is a human readable config format that helps specify the elements on the model such as the IO formats, input and output fields,
variables needed etc.

The model mar produced can be executed on different target environments -

•	The AW notebook server for development

•	DMP in production

•	Standalone on a dedicated internal FICO server.

Thus given a feature file, the same model mar is expected to work for all three environments. Modifications to the feature file by the user require that a new model mar be built using the MDK. The new mar will also need to be redeployed as necessary.

== Instructions to build and run model using Stream Var MDK

Stream Var processes the data in streaming mode, hence data needs to be sorted before feeding it to stream Var.
