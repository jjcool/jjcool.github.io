[[pre-post-processed-variables]]

==== Functions to generate preprocessed/postprocessed fields

Following are the rules to provide operands

• If the operand is a String literal, then it has to be enclosed in single quotes wrapped in double quotes. Ex : "'foo'"
• If operand is a field(input/pre-processed/profiled/post-processed), then in has to be enclosed in double quotes. Ex : "amount"
• Numerical literal should be written as it is. (no double/single quotes required) Ex: 1
