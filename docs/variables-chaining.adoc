[[Variable-chaining]]

=== Chaining of profile variables
With Stream Var release 0.11.0, chaining of the profile variables is supported. What this means is that, the one profile variable can be profiled again to create a new variables.

There is no additional logic required in the feature file for this. This works the same way you would create any other profile variables

IMPORTANT: Cross profile variable can also be chained
